Generic astronomical primitives via pyswisseph — the isolated AGPL surface.

This module deliberately contains **only** standard astronomy: sidereal body
positions, house cusps, and rise/set times. There is no application logic,
interpretation, or product content here. A consumer application talks to this
service over HTTP and never links Swiss Ephemeris itself — keeping the copyleft
dependency behind a network boundary so the consumer can stay a separate work.

Lahiri ayanamsa + Whole-Sign houses are the default conventions; they are
applied here so callers receive ready-to-use sidereal numbers.
